# Advent Of Code 2024
This repo contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024.

This year I will be using Go. Firt Time using Go, so expect some bad code. I will try to streamline it as much as I can.

## Run Locally
- Navigate to the subdirectory of the day you want 
- On your terminal, run
```Bash
go run dayX.go
```
- If you want to only the 1st or the 2nd part of the solution, use the flag `--part=` and the respective number. For example
```Bash
go run dayX.go --part=1
```
